		<h1>Here are my answers to the introductory questions:</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>My name is Dominique Senteza, and I am a junior in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences</li>
			<li>I have taken web development, web prototyping, and IoT courses. I am really interested in pursuing UI/UX as a career and think this class would really help develop some of my web design skills</li>
			<li>I have pretty high proficiency in HTML and CSS and a more moderate level of proficiency wit JS</li>
			<li>I hope to learn how to build sites that are more that just functional, but are also visually appealing and display and intended brand</li>
			<li>Designing for the screen differs from paper because the designer has to keep in mind how the page will look on multiple screen sizes, because not everyone keeps their browsers on full screen at all times (AND) people look at content on mobile devices and tablets as well.</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.katieehrlich.com/" target="_blank">Katie Ehrlich's Online Portfolio (website with effective design)</a>
				<ul>
					<li>This online portfolio has an effective design because it is simple with good organization that tells the user exactly where each link will take them. And the images that accompany each link on the home page do effevtively give users a preview of what they will see once the link is clicked.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/" target="_blank">Spotify (website with effective communication)</a>
				<ul>
					<li>The Spotify homepage does a good job of effective communication because it not only lists out the types of memberships and provide easily accessible links to other helpful information, but it also gives some information on popular music and howto use its service (which would help entice a potential customer to join. However, it has some issues with displaying the information in a visually appealing way when the window is resized.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Squarespace (website that works well)</a>  
				<ul> 
					<li>I think the Squarespace homepage works extremely well because it looks visually appealing as well as showcases its product. By being set up in a way that we as users could also set up our own personal sites, Squarespace has effectively backed up their product as a legitimate resource for individuals looking to set up their own sites.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
