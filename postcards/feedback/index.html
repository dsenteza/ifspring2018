		<h2>Quote #1</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Minimize space between quote and person's name</li>
			<li>If you switch the quote to the other side of the dog 
				you might be able to crop tighter on the dog (in the mobile view)
			while still having background space to lay the text over</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Quote #2</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Minimize space between quote and person's name</li>
			<li>Try darkening the base of the desktop view to increase contrast between 
			text and floor/baby's pants</li>
			<li>The text blends in a bit with the dog's nose on the mobile view. 
				Moving it to a more centered location so it has a darker background 
				to layer over.</li> 
		</ul>
		<h2>Quote #3</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Minimize space between quote and person's name</li>
			<li>For the mobile view, try darkening the bottom so the text doesn't 
			blend in so much with the dog</li>
		</ul>
